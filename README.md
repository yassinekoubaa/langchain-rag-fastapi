# langchain-rag-fastapi

ðŸ‘‹ **Hey there!**

Welcome to my playground for experimenting with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). This is a lightweight backend API that answers questions based on your own documentsâ€”perfect for tinkering with GenAI and building practical tools.

Iâ€™m building this as part of my hands-on AI journey, and I hope it inspires you to try out some of these modern AI techniques!

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside

- **LangChain** for managing the RAG pipeline  
- **FAISS** for super-fast semantic search  
- **FastAPI** for a speedy, modern backend  
- **Easy integration** with front-end tools (like FlutterFlow)  
- **Deploy anywhere**: Codespaces, Docker, or your favorite cloud

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-rag-fastapi.git
cd langchain-rag-fastapi
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the API server

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## ðŸ›  Example Usage

Once the serverâ€™s running, you can ask questions using `curl`, Postman, or any HTTP client. Hereâ€™s a simple example with `curl`:

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"question": "Your question here related to you docs?"}'

## ðŸ¤” Why Did I Build This?

Iâ€™m fascinated by making AI actually useful in the real worldâ€”not just cool demos. RAG is a game-changer because it:

- Reduces hallucinations (AI making stuff up)
- Grounds answers in your own data
- Makes AI safer and more reliable for businesses

These approaches are especially important for industries like consulting and professional services, where accuracy and trust matter.
